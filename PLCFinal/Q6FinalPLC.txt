Q6. 
Give an denotational semantic definition of the following:
- Python for
- Java class
- C++ function
- C switch
- Java Boolean expression

Ans: 
a) Python for: It is a iterator based loop. It iterates over tuples, dictionary, string, set, and lists. When it iterates over a sequence its called a traversal, this continues until it hits the end of the sequence.
 Ex. This code iterates over items and prints out each element in a list
        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
	for x in fruits:
  	   print(x)
        
        
b) Java class: It is a user defined name to where the user can create objects of the class. It is a constructor for the objects and represents a set of properties or methods that can be common for the objects
Ex. 

public class Main{
 public static void main(String[] args){
  System.out.println("I am Strong");
  int k = 99;
  }
}


c) C++ Function: Set of more than 1 statements that takes in input(s) and has some output(s). Functions serves as a source of reusability of code to reduce amount of code.

d) C Switch: is the combination of one or more cases and it replaces the if then else statement and compares the input variable to multiple different values. 
Syntax:
switch(input) {
case 1:
break;
case 2:
break;
case 3:
break;
default:
}

e) Java Booleans Expressions: value that is TRUE or FALSE used for evaluating different expressions, they use boolean data type and used with mathmatical expressions, >, <, >=, <=, ==. !=.

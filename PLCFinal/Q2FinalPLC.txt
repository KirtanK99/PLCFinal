Q2. 25 Points
Prove Total correctness of the following code block, and list all axioms and inference 
rules used to determine this:
 double answer = 1, d = 0.00001;
 while (answer*answer <= num){
 answer += d;
 }
 if (answer*answer > num) {
 answer -= d;
 }
 // { answer = sqrt(num) }



Answer: 
// double variables being declared and defined.
double answer = 1, d = 0.00001;
while (answer*answer <= num){ // conditions are checked for the while loop
answer += d; // This statement performs the addition operation
} // 
if (answer*answer > num) { // Specific condition is checked up using conditional statement(if-statement)
answer -= d; // a subtraction statement 
} // if loop ends
// { answer = sqrt(num) }  the answer
